# csl-letters
A mobile-responsive custom search engine to quickly and efficiently sift through Lewisâ€™s 3,208 letters.

# tech
XML, jQuery, Materialize

# goals
Using Google Books or Amazon's "Look Inside" feature to search through massive, multi-volume works is too fragmentary and inefficient. After writing a custom program (https://github.com/jwkeena/microsoft-word-xml-to-json-converter) to convert the ~4,000 pages of Microsoft Word files of Lewis' three volumes of Collected Letters from their native XML into JavaScript objects, I then built the search engine and mobile-responsive UI. Searches can be performed not only for word matches, but also for any combination of recipient, year(s), volume(s), and archival location.
